# Analysis 

## H1. There is a relationship between monthly pay and performance rating. Correlation and significance test, with a scatterplot and fit line.
h1 = final_tbl%>% cor_test(MonthlyIncome, PerformanceRating)
h1

## H2. Monthly pay differs by department. ANOVA and significance tests, with a boxplot split by department. Include a traditional ANOVA summary table (component name, SS, df, MS, F, p).
h2 = final_tbl %>% anova_test(MonthlyIncome ~ Department, detailed = TRUE)
h2

## H3. Tenure can be predicted from relationship satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by gender. Regression and significance tests, with scatterplot and fit lines. Note that youâ€™ll need to plot predicted values (i.e., marginal effects), not raw data. Include a table of coefficients, t-tests, and p-values only (no SEs), with meaningful labels.
h3 = lm(YearsAtCompany ~ 1 + RelationshipSatisfaction + RelationshipSatisfaction * Gender, data = final_tbl)
H3_summary = summary(h3)
h3_preds = fitted(h3) # Getting predicted values for scatterplot
h3_tbl = cbind(h3_preds, final_tbl)

## Publication results for H1:
# Interpretation: The correlation between monthly income and performance ratings
# was r(1468) = -.02, p = .51. This test was not statistically significant using
# an alpha value of .05. We fail to reject our null hypothesis that there is no 
# relationship between between monthly pay and performance ratings. In other words,
# our Hypothesis 1 that there is a relationship between monthly pay and performance rating is not supported by our findings.
# *** although this is likely due to range restriction in our dependent variable, performance ratings which have a range of 3-4.
