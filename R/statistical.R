# Analysis 

## Hypothesis 1. There is a relationship between monthly pay and performance rating. Correlation and significance test, with a scatterplot and fit line.
h1 = final_tbl%>% cor_test(MonthlyIncome, PerformanceRating)
h1

## Hypothesis 2. Monthly pay differs by department. ANOVA and significance tests, with a boxplot split by department. Include a traditional ANOVA summary table (component name, SS, df, MS, F, p).

## h2 = aov(MonthlyIncome ~ Department, data = final_tbl)
h2 = final_tbl %>% anova_test(MonthlyIncome ~ Department, detailed = TRUE)
h2


## Hypothesis 3. Tenure can be predicted from relationship satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by gender. Regression and significance tests, with scatterplot and fit lines. Note that youâ€™ll need to plot predicted values (i.e., marginal effects), not raw data. Include a table of coefficients, t-tests, and p-values only (no SEs), with meaningful labels.
h3 = lm(YearsAtCompany ~ 1 + RelationshipSatisfaction + RelationshipSatisfaction * Gender, data = final_tbl)
H3_summary = summary(h3)
### These predicted values are used for creating scatterplot
h3_preds = fitted(h3)



# Visualization

## Hypothesis 1: Scatterplot
(final_tbl %>% ggplot(aes(x = MonthlyIncome, y = PerformanceRating)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter") + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Figure 1. Scatterplot for Monthly Income and Performance Ratings",
       x = "Monthly Income ($)", y = "Performance Ratings") + 
  theme_minimal()) %>% 
  ggsave(filename="../fig/H1.png", units="px", width=1920, height=1080)


## Hypothesis 2: Boxplot
(final_tbl %>% ggplot(aes(x = Department, y = MonthlyIncome)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Figure 2. Boxplot for Monthly Income by Department",
       x = "Department", y = "Monthly Income ($)") + 
  theme_minimal()) %>% 
  ggsave(filename="../fig/H2.png", units="px", width=1920, height=1080)


## Hypothesis 3 (VERY CONFUSED BY THIS)
h3_tbl = cbind(h3_preds, final_tbl)
(h3_tbl %>% ggplot(aes(x = RelationshipSatisfaction, y = h3_preds, color = Gender, fill = Gender)) + 
  geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(dodge.width = 0.1, jitter.height = 0.25)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Figure 3. Scatterplot for relationship statisfaction and predicted tenure",
       x = "Relationship Statisfaction", y = "Predictd Tenure (years)") + 
  theme_minimal() )%>%
  ggsave(filename="../fig/H3.png", units="px", width=1920, height=1080)

## Publication results for H1 
### Interpretation: The correlation between monthly income and performance ratings was r(1468) = -0.017, p = 0.512. This test was not statistically significant. This means that there is virtually no relationship between monthly income and performance ratings. Our hypothesis (1) that there is a relationship between monthly pay and performance rating is rejected using an alpha value of .05, although this is likely due to range restriction in our dependent variable, performance ratings which have a range of 3-4.
paste0("The correlation between monthly income and performance ratings was r(",

       ") = ", 
       display_num,
       ", p = ",
       display_num(h1$p),
       ". This test was ",
       ifelse(h1$p <= .05, "", "not "),
       "statistically significant.")

### Interpretation: 

#### Extracting information to construct ANOVA table in publication

SS_between = h2$SSn
SS_within = h2$SSd
SS_total = SS_between + SS_within

H3_tbl = tidy(h3) %>%
