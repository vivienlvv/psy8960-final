# ITEMS TO CHECK: H2, H3 viz and test


# Data Import and Cleaning
final_tbl = readRDS("../data/combined_tbl.RDS")




# Analysis 

## Hypothesis 1. There is a relationship between monthly pay and performance rating. Correlation and significance test, with a scatterplot and fit line.
h1 = final_tbl%>% cor_test(MonthlyIncome, PerformanceRating)
h1

## Hypothesis 2. Monthly pay differs by department. ANOVA and significance tests, with a boxplot split by department. Include a traditional ANOVA summary table (component name, SS, df, MS, F, p).

## h2 = aov(MonthlyIncome ~ Department, data = final_tbl)
h2 = final_tbl %>% anova_test(MonthlyIncome ~ Department, detailed = TRUE)

### Extracting information to construct ANOVA table in publication 
component_name = c("SS_Between", "SS_within", "SS_total")

SS_between = h2$SSn
SS_within = h2$SSd

df_between = h2$DFn
df_within = h2$DFd

MS_between = SS_between/df_between
MS_within = SS_within/df_within

f_val = h2$F
p_val = h2$p


  
  
## Hypothesis 3. Tenure can be predicted from relationship satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by gender. Regression and significance tests, with scatterplot and fit lines. Note that youâ€™ll need to plot predicted values (i.e., marginal effects), not raw data. Include a table of coefficients, t-tests, and p-values only (no SEs), with meaningful labels.
h3 = lm(YearsAtCompany ~ 1 + RelationshipSatisfaction + RelationshipSatisfaction * Gender, data = final_tbl)
summary(h3)
h3_preds = fitted(h3)



# Visualization

## Hypothesis 1: Scatterplot
final_tbl %>% ggplot(aes(x = MonthlyIncome, y = PerformanceRating)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter") + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Figure 1. Scatterplot for Monthly Income and Performance Ratings",
       x = "Monthly Income ($)", y = "Performance Ratings") + 
  theme_minimal()


## Hypothesis 2: Boxplot
final_tbl %>% ggplot(aes(x = Department, y = MonthlyIncome)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Figure 2. Boxplot for Monthly Income by Department",
       x = "Department", y = "Monthly Income ($)") + 
  theme_minimal()

## Hypothesis 3 (VERY CONFUSED BY THIS)
h3_tbl = cbind(h3_preds, final_tbl)
h3_tbl %>% ggplot(aes(x = RelationshipSatisfaction, y = h3_preds, color = Gender, fill = Gender)) + 
  geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(dodge.width = 0.1, jitter.height = 0.25)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Figure 3. Scatterplot for relationship statisfaction and predicted tenure",
       x = "Relationship Statisfaction", y = "Predictd Tenure (years)") + 
  theme_minimal()


# Publication

## Publication results for H1 
### Publication ready sentence: There is a slight negative and non-significant relationship between monthly income and performance ratings, r(1468) = -.02, p = 0.512 > 0.05. This means that there is virtually no relationship between monthly income and performance ratings. This is likely due to range restriction in our dependent variable, performance ratings which have a range of 3-4. 
paste0("The correlation betweeen monthly income and performance ratings was r(",
       nrow(final_tbl)-2, 
       ") = ",
