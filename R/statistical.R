# Analysis 

## Hypothesis 1. There is a relationship between monthly pay and performance rating. Correlation and significance test, with a scatterplot and fit line.
h1 = final_tbl%>% cor_test(MonthlyIncome, PerformanceRating)
h1

## Hypothesis 2. Monthly pay differs by department. ANOVA and significance tests, with a boxplot split by department. Include a traditional ANOVA summary table (component name, SS, df, MS, F, p).

## h2 = aov(MonthlyIncome ~ Department, data = final_tbl)
h2 = final_tbl %>% anova_test(MonthlyIncome ~ Department, detailed = TRUE)
h2


## Hypothesis 3. Tenure can be predicted from relationship satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by gender. Regression and significance tests, with scatterplot and fit lines. Note that youâ€™ll need to plot predicted values (i.e., marginal effects), not raw data. Include a table of coefficients, t-tests, and p-values only (no SEs), with meaningful labels.
h3 = lm(YearsAtCompany ~ 1 + RelationshipSatisfaction + RelationshipSatisfaction * Gender, data = final_tbl)
H3_summary = summary(h3)
h3_preds = fitted(h3) # Getting predicted values for scatterplot




# Visualization

## Hypothesis 1: Scatterplot
(final_tbl %>% ggplot(aes(x = MonthlyIncome, y = PerformanceRating)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter") + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Figure 1. Scatterplot for Monthly Income and Performance Ratings",
       x = "Monthly Income ($)", y = "Performance Ratings") + 
  theme_minimal()) %>% 
  ggsave(filename="../fig/H1.png", units = "px", width = 1920, height = 1080)


## Hypothesis 2: Boxplot
(final_tbl %>% ggplot(aes(x = Department, y = MonthlyIncome)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Figure 2. Boxplot for Monthly Income by Department",
       x = "Department", y = "Monthly Income ($)") + 
  theme_minimal()) %>% 
  ggsave(filename="../fig/H2.png", units = "px", width = 1920, height = 1080)


## Hypothesis 3 (VERY CONFUSED BY THIS)
h3_tbl = cbind(h3_preds, final_tbl)
(h3_tbl %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = RelationshipSatisfaction, y = h3_preds, color = Gender, fill = Gender)) + 
    geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(dodge.width = 0.1, jitter.height = 0.25)) + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Figure 3. Scatterplot for the relationship statisfaction and predicted tenure",
       x = "Relationship Statisfaction",
       y = "Predictd Tenure (years)") + 
  theme_minimal()) %>%
  ggsave(filename="../fig/H3.png", units = "px", width = 1920, height = 1080)

### Interpretation: The correlation between monthly income and performance ratings was r(1468) = -0.017, p = 0.512. This test was not statistically significant. This means that there is virtually no relationship between monthly income and performance ratings. Our hypothesis (1) that there is a relationship between monthly pay and performance rating is rejected using an alpha value of .05, although this is likely due to range restriction in our dependent variable, performance ratings which have a range of 3-4.

### Interpretation (Publication ready sentence): Given the output from the ANOVA table, we can see that monthly pay significantly differs by department F(2,1467) = 3.20, p = .04. Using alpha = .05, we reject the null hypothesis that monthly income does not differ by department. In other words, we have evidence for hypothesis 2 that monthly pay does differ by department.

# Interpretation (Publication ready sentence): Given the output from the regression table, the main effect of relationship satisfaction (b = .37, p = .11) on tenureand the moderating effect of gender on such relationship (b = -.43,p = .16) are not statistically significant at alpha = .05. In other words, the results fail to provide support for Hypothesis 3 which states that tenure can be predicted from relationship satisfaction and that such relationship is moderated by gender.
