What more do you want from an employer."."Younger employees complaining about the company not catering to their individual careers aspirations. There is a misconception out there, that if you get into Google you can move about the company internally super easily.

A majority of coworkers are smart, talented, well-intentioned people. Gyms, exercise classes, music rooms, language programs are amazing.  Go into it realizing that even though it's Google, it's still a huge corporate, lead by"."The Google culture is mostly a facade. There are many programs and tools designed to foster things like psychological safety, inclusiveness, mindfulness... but they are pretty shallow. It's like they are there just because that's what ""progressive"" companies do. They are created, and probably managed based on data that the leaders have no idea how to interpret. It doesn't come from the heart, because AI androids don't have hearts, of course. I used a contact form to report witnessing blatant sexism by senior leaders. My report went unanswered. I contacted my HRBP to discuss a sensitive topic. S/he acted like I was just a bother.  The legendary perks have faded. Of course, the standard health/stock/retirement benefits are fantastic. But the food and fun budgets are dwindling fast.  Perhaps worst of all: like so many prestigious institutions, Google attracts people who are driven by status. The result is that you have too many with slick credentials but mediocre talent, and almost no authentic interest in industry. Then, instead of producing great work, they get along with strategic elbow-rubbing and excessive self-promotion.  Speaking of self-promotion, the performance review process is onerous and unhelpful. But not anymore than that at most big companies, from what I hear.  All that said, I'm incredibly grateful for my job, even as I plot my escape. If I were a few years younger and more amenable to the corporate lifestyle, I'd be all in for several years, at least.".1154

"* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused). * The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.), overnight ski trips to Vermont, overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer, summer picnics at Chelsea piers, and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially. * Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants. * There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody. * It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are). * The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive. * No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.  Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement. * Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand. * If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding, but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance."."* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension). * The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows, as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse. * Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.".3

Coworkers are very smart, generally pleasant, and good to work with."."Very few cons. Mainly, it's getting a bit large, so it's hard to have a sense of how you are contributing. The promotion system is designed to be fair by having anonymous committees review written packets and you can self-nominate, but as a result the burden of proving you are promotable is extremely high. You (or your manager) really have to be focused on promotion, find and work on projects with the right demonstrable complexity and impact, and have extensive written documentation and peer statements to validate.

"This team has the potential to be best they can be but they need to get out of their own way with their egotistical know it all attitude."."This Playstore Production Management team are some of the most pompous, arrogant, juvenile punks I have ever had the misfortune of coming across. My manager wanted to know when things weren't getting done or were going wrong but when I approached him he would be defensive, accusing, openly blaming and quite snotty and offensive. This is not the hallmark of anyone cut out to manager other people. When approaching him with concerns or mistakes, he would twist and turn things around on me that I was blaming other people. And I thought, are you for real? The female manager was one of the most pompous peacocks that could of used a little ego balancing and reality check. I have news for you, you cannot brow beat, lecture and force feed your sloppy training program and then get on your high horse and lecture people that they are not meeting your expectations. Your training program was like trying to follow an untied off balloon let go in a room. This team is scatterbrained and cocky and comes across as hair on fire, them gets snippy when things go wrong. Then you will get a email that says ""Oh, now I see how this was confusing, my bad!"" Well, the damage was already done. Here's a clue. Treat your contractors like the qualified, professionals who have brains, skills and common sense that you fail to acknowledge or bother to allow an ounce of autonomy to prove themselves without your nitpicking micromanaging.".277

I have un-learned any skill that I may have had that permitted me to operate in a cut-throat workplace. I'd probably suffer through a steep learning curve if I moved to a company where people are mean. 2. I now know that you *can* have a nice career in an collaborative and cooperative environment, and that that's even healthier and more productive than the cut-throat workplaces. So I'd be constantly reminded of that if I ever left. 3.

Your performance review isn't based on a scale, but instead it ends up being based on a pass/fail opinion. A poor director/admin fit means that the admin will suffer. Admins have to step up to offer emotional/career support for each other because there is not an internal management system in place specifically for them.

Also there is a desire to maintain a startup mentality and culture but Google is far from a startup.".1189
"Fantastic food perks and amenities like gym, laundry, etc. I'm pretty sure you could actually *live* on campus (unofficially) pretty comfortably, I know people who have.  Compensation is generous for employees, but be prepared to be given the runaround by your agency if you are are a temp, vendor, or contractor."."[Full-timers] Don't believe the hype, who your manager is matters a lot more than the ""unicorns and rainbows"" corporate culture that gets all the press. Lay the groundwork for transferring if your boss seems to be withholding information from you, or seems to have an agenda. Set well-defined, NON-SUBJECTIVE OKRs or you may get burned at perf.  [Temps/Vendors] For TVCs, just be happy for the free food and the nice resume builder, your vendor manager probably sees you as more of a nuisance than an asset and will give you the runaround when it comes time to review pay or conversion opportunities. Also, FTEs are likely oblivious of your situation if they themselves were not TVCs before getting convert, and just assume you have sick days, access to internal websites, events, etc.".1348

Some of the people are very nice too."."Seems that most people are on the arrogant side that work here. When I try to say a simple, ""hello"" to people, they turn their head and look away or down at their phones. Not sure what this is all about, but it comes across as very rude. Most of the people here are also very young and look alike (skinny and aesthetically well maintained), and it makes a person that is older, let's say 40+ feel unwelcome to apply because they don't feel as if they would have a chance. There are a few older people, but not many. So, these two complaints I've actually heard others mention as well. Overall feel is that they are hiring only certain types of people, even though their countless training videos say that they are supposed to be fair and square across the board.".650

Avoid the People Operations ""Global People Services"" (GPS) team. The leadership of that organization (the Vice-President) is very hierarchical, is not transparent, is very top-down, and keeps around managers who consistently get bad reviews from their directs. Nothing is done when HR reports are filed. This is ironic since this organization sits within HR. The culture is toxic, and employees are told that the best way to get promoted is to listen to what managers say and follow their lead.

The past 5 years of price-doubling have prevented me from getting into the market even at my good software engineer salary. Priced out of market -- seriously. The people who can bear to live near work are married Google couples, new grads from India or China living together crammed into crappy small houses... or people who bought a place 5 years ago before $750k, 2 bedroom, 1200 sq ft houses became $1.5M.

"Google is a world of its own. At every other company, there were lots of people who had serious gaps in their skills. At Google, I could have a serious work conversation about technology with everyone and could trust that they have solid expertise. In that way, Google is a sheltered garden from the rest of the world.  There is a general sense of trust in the company. You can leave your valuables and laptops lying around, and they are safe. People joke that it's the only place where you use an expansive laptop to reserve a seat at the cafeteria, while walking away.  At other companies, teams are very protective of their own code. Trying to execute another team's code requires following a 50 step installation process that's out of date and was never complete to begin with. Google has almost all the code in the same source repository. An engineer can look at the code, easily execute the code because it comes with intelligent defaults and standard build process, and contribute enhancements/bug fixes. The other teams are generally grateful for getting improvements. They understand that it's better for the company if the bug is fixed rather than holding onto territory or insisting on their own strange ways.  Google takes care of you all around. From food, health care, generous vacation, onsite gym, and so on, you are well taken care off and can focus on work rather than dealing with life's hassles. There are cases where Google goes above and beyond tremendously. Here is an example that floats around internally. A Googler had worked at Amazon before. Amazon relocated him. Because of the relocation, he had to change his partner's health insurance for some critical and expensive life changing medication. Due to same sex partner and relocation, the health insurance company refused. Amazon was so unhelpful that the HR representative who was forced to deliver the news broke down crying and then quit over it. He switched to Google. The Google HR department negotiated an exception for him with the health insurance and included the necessary change for the following policy year for all employees.  A lot of Google products have a huge impact with over a billion users. Working there, you can feel that you change the world.  I was very happy with the compensation. There are also a lot of opportunities in the company to follow your interest. Pretty much anyone can get an intern, participate in setting coding standards (obviously you have to argue the case for your proposals), interviewing, supporting local schools with tech expertise. Google opened up a lot of opportunities in the community or in general in tech to volunteer in.  Google is considered the largest functioning anarchy. That has its good sides, like the glee of joy for operating without strict oversight. It also has its dark side, like a hands-off management tends to encourage politics.  Another beauty for engineers are internal tools. Your development environment is in the cloud. You can sit down at a loaner computer and be productive within seconds. There is a massive cloud compiling system that shards your compiles across many computers in the cloud. The search function across the codebase is powerful. You'll feel that downloading and compiling code on your own computer in your IDE is something of another epoch, like something from before the industrial revolution.  The Google badge is a wonderful thing to carry. It opens doors to a different world. The office spaces are beautiful with work, rest, and play areas. The MTV location is like a utopian city on its own. Everything in it, food, drinks, work spaces, swimming pools, gym, bowling alleys, showers, and so on are free (for employees). It is a whole world of its own.  Most companies have a one-over-one promotion model. Your boss has to decide to promote you. Your bosses boss has to sign off on it. At Google, the promotion is decided by a relatively impartial committee that due to promoting lots of people has experience in it. You can even get promoted in rare cases against the will of your manager. Rumor has it that managers won't hold a grudge if that happens but support it. The hiring committee looks at a promotion packet that includes reviews from peers. There can even be unrequested peer reviews. In general, it creates an environment that discourages bicycling - bowing to the higher ups and kicking the lower downs hard. However some people have realized that they can hurt colleagues with bad reviews and impunity. It's rare, but colleagues careers took a dive due to someone holding a grudge or simply writing a thoughtless review. (There is some concern about stack ranking, but I don't understand enough of the background to comment on it. There are plenty of discussions with insight elsewhere.)  To underscore how Google is one of a kind, there is an internal database with legendary things that happened at Google. Someone parked his car for many years on the employee parking lot. When after years, he went looking for his car, it was gone. He went to security. He found out that it was simply moved because the parking lot had been repaved. Another Googler lived in the office fulltime to save money on rent. He wrote a guide on how to do that. As there are showers and other facilities, it is possible to do so. And Google let it happen. After a while of saving rent payment, he could afford the down payment on buying his own place. All these stories make Google a wonderful place to work at.  An important topic to bring up is work/life balance. Work/life balance is an amorphous topic that means a lot of different things to different people. Getting up to speed at Google is consuming. Depending on your work, it could take a year to become productive. Many colleagues reported no longer having a personal life after starting at Google. Some colleagues simply love technology and can't think of anything better than working until the AM hours on some tech that gets them excited. You can tell these people by physically looking at them. For them, it is a heaven. If you are a balanced person with personal interests and relationships, you are likely going to be challenged. If you signed up for one of the big five tech companies, you wanted challenge, right. If I would do something differently, it is to take advantage of all time saving things. Pay for a laundry service. Pay for a cleaning service. I've had a moral hangup about doing that because on a moral level, my time shouldn't be more worthy than that of another human being. If I could do it all over again, I'd pay for every possible service to save time. In the grander scheme of things, if you work at Google, your skill is so valuable to humanity that you should make use of it instead of standing in line at the grocery store. I don't mean that in an arrogant way. If you work on a service with a billion users, your ability to make life better for them with another hour of work is worth more than folding laundry. You've paid the price in education, training, and effort to be able to do that. Make use of your power for the great code. (The view that all those perks are only there to keep your nose closer to the grindstone is the wrong way of looking at it from a philosophical point, in my humble opinion.)  For full disclosure, there are some people who coast at Google. They probably don't have any complains about work/life balance or perhaps the worst complaints because they are all about coasting.  Many company mishandle projects. When the next time comes around, they mishandle it in the same way because the people responsible aren't the ones working late nights and weekends. Google does two things to get better: (1) There are honest and public postmortems. They are the pride of a lot of true engineers. (2) Zeitgeist is an annual survey about the work place and the company. The survey is quite exhaustive. Every manager from the CEO to the front-line manager reports on the result of his/her area. Then they take actions to attempt to improve areas that got low scores. Having worked at companies where now improvement effort is done, this annual and systematic process is very refreshing."."If you don't work in MTV (HQ), you will be given work. However if you are passionate and want to advance your career, you should relocated to MTV. Any project that started doing well and getting important seemed to get transferred there. Promotion opportunities are better there. It seemed that everyone who relocated from another location to MTV, was a lot happier.  Officially, the company focuses on impact. In practice, it seems to focus on being highly productive in producing code, but not necessarily in actually succeeding. In theory, if you have a simple idea that doubles the revenue/customer satisfaction, it should be more appreciated than an idea that took a lot of effort/difficulty and had less improvement. But it tends to be the other way.  Promotions tend to be tied to launching a project that makes peers at a higher level happy. That's often easier with an API that happens to be really useful for peers than launches that benefit users. Landing the right kind of project to work on is a big factor of getting a promotion, which is easier in MTV and also encourages politics. A colleague was told directly from his boss that he has to get better at ""turf war.""  A general rule of thumb is that everyone ends up in ads. Non-ads projects tend to be more volatile and have a tendency to end with people ending up on ads projects. This is not necessarily a con. One should simply prepare for it.  There seems to be a general trend as Google gets larger (60K+ employees) and the founders are withdrawing their impact on the company that Google's specialty is fading a bit. Microkitchens stock less eye popping snacks and drinks. The Christmas gift went from a nice bundle of cash to a coveted phone to a cheap phone to simply a donation to a charity of your choice. The hiring bar seems to get lowered to satisfy the need to hire more people.  Managers tend to become managers for their tech skills and not management skills. It definitely shows in the quality of management. Very smart people, very technically capable, not so business and people savvy. This is not necessarily a complete con because a manager without a clue in tech is definitely a lot worse.  There are some stars that people belief that Google still has but doesn't. The myth of 20% time is alive outside of Google. It's discouraged inside of Google. The only person whom I knew to participate in 20% time did so by working on another team, which he wanted to test out before transferring. Outside people belief that 1 day a week a Google can work on anything he/she deems interesting. Management doesn't outright deny it, but it's formulated as: If you work 20% time on something else, it has to have company impact worth 20%. This is not necessarily a con. It's more like a missing pro.  Another shining star that's gone is the ""don't be evil"" motto. It was silently dropped and replaced with ""do the right thing."" Google didn't turn overnight evil. There is some philosophical case to be made why the new motto is better. However it seems with the founders drawing back from company involvement that the dramatic standing up for users of the old times is also fading. Google is still a far cry from Monsanto.  If you work there and want to advance your career, don't volunteer for anything. It is kind of viewed as a ""vacation"" if you volunteer for things. For example at other employers, interviewing was viewed as a prestigious activity reserved for the most trusted employees to shape the future. At Google, any hour you spend interviewing means missing an hour to increase your performance score. You'll be rewarded for finding ways to dug out of the interviewing responsibility. Again this is not necessarily a con, simply something to understand.  You are going to meet some of the brightest and most brilliant people. You are going to meet people with interesting backgrounds. You are going to have wonderfully engaging conversations. But all of that intelligence tends to also have caused nature to create that intelligence at a trade-off (in some people). Perhaps a lack of humanity or emotion was the price of it in some people. You are going to have some lunch conversations that are going to make you spit your food back out, like a colleague seriously proposing to use nuclear bombs to solve social issues. I sometimes felt the need to take a break from the office to be around people who display normal emotions (or any emotion). While the general office culture is very liberal/progressive, there are some pockets of social beliefs that are breathtaking to how little they care about human life or different lifestyles/opinions out of some law of the strong or ultra libertarian reasoning.".5

You'll learn what it looks like when engineering is done right. Stay for more than a few years and recruiters won't be able to get enough of you. ""Ex-Googler"" carries a lot of weight, and I've seen lots of people leave Google to take on shockingly influential roles at startups and other companies."."Promotions are extremely demanding. When in doubt, the entire organization defaults to ""no,"" so you'll need to jump through a lot of hoops to get promoted. Promotions are centered around complexity and impact, which tends to discourage simple solutions to important product problems, as well as low-impact but important work like code maintenance.  There have been some attempts to encourage more code maintenance but in my opinion it isn't being rewarded enough. As a result, there is a number of roles that people take on that you tend not to see, most notably that of the code style stickler whose impact comes in the form of improving existing code.  Also on the topic of impact, you can execute a large, multi-year project and still not get promoted if it doesn't land with the expected impact.  --  This depends on personal preference, but the office spaces are almost universally open-plan, which some people find makes it difficult to focus. Google NYC has been in a real estate crunch for over four years, and people are being hired faster than we can build office space to accommodate them. Lots of trading floor-style desks.  --  Personal projects and side hustles are limited to what doesn't compete with any Google products. In theory it sounds reasonable, but in reality Google has a finger in pretty much every pie, which means you'll have to ask permission for everything you make outside work.".55

They do give you time and a percentage allocation towards independent study but it can get repetitive and no longer challenging. Some people enjoy just being there but I need to have constant challenge.

"1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.  2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.  3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).  5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true.  6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below)."."1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am. It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.  2) Poor management. I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence. Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult."" People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into. So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.  3) Jerks. Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same). Years ago, that wasn't the case. I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.  4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy. So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing. Google says, ""Don't be evil."" But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices. :(".2
"Great Salary, Great Benefits, Free Food! Management really cares, Google really cares about their employees.

"Access to the larger Google culture and benefits -- gyms, food, campus benefits, etc."."I hear from people around the company that Google proper is great and that Cloud is not representative of the true Google work experience.

"The tooling is incredible. For example, you can make a change to the compiler, libc and your application logic all in the same change list (the equivalent of a commit in Git) and get that change integrated into and tested against the entire Google codebase.  The technical depth is fantastic. The place is full of thoughtful people that are happy to lend their expertise. Overall, everyone is nice and smart -- not a combination you find everywhere.  Despite the size and maturity of the company and its products, many new and significant development efforts are afoot, engineers are encouraged to think boldly. Google is not afraid to rebuild things, even very fundamental things. And because everything is generally well tested -- automated testing is big here -- huge changes are landed all the time with few regressions. I can't go into specifics, but the amount and scale of ongoing changes is extraordinary, much more than you would expect at an established company. And I'm not even working on the hot new things like AI or Android.  Technical leadership runs very high up the management chain."."There is a lot of complexity, and much of the tooling is custom.

"I learned a lot from my colleagues the 5 years I was there. Everyone is very intelligent and generally great at what they do. Google is constantly pushing the envelope in every way that they do things, and there is a lot of tolerance for taking risks. Still remarkably transparent to employees despite its size (70k+ people). They also try to keep the environment fun. They aren't afraid to give large responsibilities to relatively young people (i.e. in mid twenties). Most large companies wouldn't trust young people with the same scope and impact of work. Very easy to get interviews with other companies once Google is on your resume."."They try to make the performance review process fair, but a lot of it is still based on politics and favoritism. Your experience is almost entirely dependent on your manager and core team. Google is overall a great company to employees, but your day-to-day experience is defined by your core team. That being said, the company is large and constantly hiring, so if you hate your team, you can probably move to a new one relatively quickly.".759

There are no promotions from this job and getting a transfer to a different job can be difficult (depending on your location). Doing the same job for 5+ years while waiting for a transfer to be available is boring.  The work can be physically difficult, many employees get repetitive stress injuries, back pain etc after a few years. Cutthroat competitive work environment leads to people rushing to have the best numbers and getting hurt.  Performance review process doesn't always fairly reflect work and there are no appeals.

NA."These aren't even really ""cons"" but things that are so different from the typical Fortune 500 company that you should be aware of: - Working with such smart people can lead to ""imposter syndrome"" - feeling that you aren't good enough or don't belong. - With great freedom to manage your own work, you have to be able to thrive in ambiguity. You won't get a list of work items at Google. - When everyone else has that same freedom, ""herding the cats"" requires a lot of people skills. You can't fall back on management to give diktats and expect that people will fall into line. The only true negative is the very high political level of group-think. If you are right-leaning, middle of the road, or even slightly left-leaning politically, you may feel shouted down if you try to participate in the wide ranging internal forums by the dominating far left (but the solution to this is easy - just ignore the political nonsense). On the plus side, with the level of dirty laundry airing that happened in 2017, this seems to be toning down and so is less of a problem than it was as of mid-2017. The media also played this up to be a bigger issue than it is.".757
"As a software engineer, one reason to go to Google is because they have some of the most impressive software and hardware infrastructure in the business. How do they manage to answer any question you can think of in under a second? How many computers do they actually have? How can you possibly manage so many computers? What does it take to run security for them? If you work there, you can (eventually) learn something about everything. And with hard work you can have a huge impact on this amazing system."."The company is big. Really big.

Chaotic approach to project management: there is a semi-constant state of reorganization that goes on, with people and projects moved from office to office and continent to continent with no concern for how this impact efficiency.  Political evaluation process. Since everyone can rate anyone else and everyone is stacked ranked against anyone else, there is a motivation to stab people in the back. People don't tend to give proper credit to other people's work for the same reason. It makes for a competitive and not very nice environment within one's own team.

C-Level executives are pretty indifferent to the 'little guy' 4. be more diverse 5. not much opportunity for advancement unless someone leaves 6. work life balance is a tough achievement if at all, I worked a lot of odd hours 7. unconscious bias is a real problem within the thinking of hiring managers 8. if you're going to transfer an employee to a different part of the country, maybe give them more than a months notice? I saw co-workers marriage fall apart because their manager simply 'forgot to schedule a meeting sooner' 9. it's very political (big little lies in a tech setting) 10. communicate feedback more effectively 11. be more diverse".259

There are many overlapping teams and products. Individuals and managers are incentivized to create new products/teams instead of contributing to existing ones.

Same goes with maternity leave: i have seen countless women being promoted during the leave based on their past performance, their job is safe. This is the way it should be. 3/ You can built whatever career path you like providing you flight for it. 4/ the company is as healthy as it can get, unlimited potential. 5/ You can move all over the world"."1/ they suck at managing the skills pool during reorgs. They shuffle you around in ways that sometimes makes no sense at all. I've had 6 reorgs in 6 years (all justified from a business standpoint). I was just unlucky, always in the team that just got reorged, but it really slowed down your career. 2/ compensation is very uneven across the globe. US and Switzerland get employees get very well paid compared to, for example, UK employees. I've had greater changes of lifestyle and comp from changing country than I did from being promoted. A bit odd. 3/ in the sales org, there is a strong tendency to promote good presenters over doers. 4/ work life balance is...well it depends. i've had jobs where I was bored out of my mind and jobs when I worked until 10pm and on Sundays. It really depends. Overall good but very uneven.".297

TGIF!) - Smart and passionate co-workers - Many pros and cons depend on your team and direct management.- Large, multi-national company bureaucracy - Lots of Type-A personalities can lead to some clashes - You'll hear about cool stuff happening in the company, but in reality everything is pretty vertically silo'ed.486

"When I was at Google, the company was growing rapidly, and I was able to grow with the company. I was quickly promoted, and benefitted from having a lot of senior, experienced people to learn from. I got to work on products used by billions of people, which is an impact that few other places can match."."Google has a lot of bad managers. They spend a ton of money trying to figure out how to make it better, but the tl,dr is that at the senior levels, a lot of the promotion committees (it's an anonymous committee, not your manager, who decides) look favorably on managing people. Especially on the manager track, the size of organization you manage seemed to matter more than how good of a manager you were. In many parts of the org, it became impossible to get the promotion to the next level unless you had a manager who was really good about helping you carve out space to manage a large organization within their org.  Career development is mostly an exercise for the reader. There's lots of opportunities available, but you have to go out and find them and push. Don't expect someone to guide you along career development.  At the senior levels, you're at a huge disadvantage outside of Mountain View. And if you're in MTV, you're either suffering a huge commute from SF, or living in an extremely overpriced boring suburb.".858

"Many smart people to learn from, competitive compensation, chance to work on big projects."."1) Google hires smartest people with rocket science background but asks them to do simple things. 2) Too many managers.

Best company to work for.I cant think of any.950
"Great place to work if you are a young, single, male software engineer."."Not a great place to work if you have a family, are female or have to manage people. Most managers do not have any management training, nor are they given any. There is no recognition given to engineering managers for their ability to help people's careers, performance, or as to how happy their people are with their manager. Almost all emphasis is placed on an engineering manager's technical contribution. Therefore, there is no incentive for managers to treat their employees well, meet with them or help them. Nor is there much incentive for managers to make good business decisions. Most engineering managers only care that they did something technically interesting. Whether it fails or not is not important. Whether it contributes to the company's strategy or business is not important. And certainly, whether their people grow and move forward with their careers is not important.".765

Food is good but fattening."."Management is a bit weak, and direction can be limited. Sometimes it was hard to find something worth working on.

They want a phd level of intelligence to work for 20$/hr. Atlanta is the neglected ""redheaded stepchild"" data center. The security staff is imbecilic, but a few became good friends.
